# Introduction

To demonstrate ECSx in a real-time application, we're going to make a game where each player will control a ship, which can sail around the map, and will attack enemies if they come too close.

> Note:  This guide will get you up-and-running with a working game, but it is intentionally generic.  Feel free to experiment with altering details from this implementation to customize your own game.

Before we get started, head over to the [Installation guide](installation.md) and follow the instructions for creating a Phoenix project with ECSx
